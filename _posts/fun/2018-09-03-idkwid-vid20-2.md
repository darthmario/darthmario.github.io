In this episode, I continue on with the Vic-20 finishing off remaining items from the first episodes and then some brand new stuff!

- Finishing the keyboard fixes
- Fixing the power switch
- Testing the memory cartridges
- Vic-20 cxpansion options
- Trying out Vic-20 IQ and personality tests!

This one ended up being way more involved than I intended, but I still had a lot of fun making it.
