Got some traction and some notice out of this commercial my buddy Don and I created (on next to nothing budget).

>You just know times are tough when Santa Claus has to kick the cinder blocks out from under his ride, put some extra feed in the reindeer and fly down to Cleveland to hock some of the old lady's jewelry and candlesticks. And that's exactly what's going on in this spot from [the Pavlish Group](http://www.pavlishgroup.com/) for Coin & Jewelry Buyers of America. (Don Pavlish dishes after the video.)
