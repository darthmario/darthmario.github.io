It's always great to see how someone approaches their craft. We expect to see code in this day of easy to view, public repos, but it's even cooler that old source is being made available. Wonderful to see techniques used in these very memory and CPU constrained devices.

>Last Sunday, the Commodore 64/128 Programming Facebook group was carrying on its business as usual when received an invaluable gift from Michael Archer â€“ the source code of many Commodore 64 games he programmed between 1986-1992.
