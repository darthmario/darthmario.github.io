Good overview of the platform that my team has built at Princess to drive our guest experience.

>With a complex system for migrating data to and from ships causing new challenges every day, Princess Cruises sought support from digital experience firm Acquia to ensure the process of using Drupal to build its onboard digital platform went smoothly.
>
>The open-source content management platform was chosen for its flexibility and ability to create customised content. Nine months later, the [Princess@Sea](http://www.princess.com/learn/onboard/activities/princess-at-sea/) app was fully developed and accessible on any device, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
