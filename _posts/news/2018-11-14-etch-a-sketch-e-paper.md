One of the most fun parts of attending the [ISCA (International Society of Caricaturist Artists)](http://www.caricature.org/) convention 2018 was watching the last part of their art fight where two caricature artists had to do a timed caricature of the other using an etch-a-sketch. Amazing what they did. Of course, me being me I had to take a look at what could be done with technology.

>Even if you don’t want to duplicate the toy, the comparison of the displays is worth watching. We were really hoping he’d included an accelerometer to erase it by shaking, but you’ll have to add that feature yourself.
