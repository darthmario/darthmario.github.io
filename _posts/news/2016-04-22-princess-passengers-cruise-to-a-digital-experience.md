>The Drupal development platform was a key to building the system, says co-project lead Hillary Neaf. The company began using the open-source framework in 2007 to develop its corporate Internet framework. "It provides a high level of flexibility and the level of security we required," she explains. "We have also benefited from the community support, and have used a lot of the Drupal forum and group input to develop the initiative."
