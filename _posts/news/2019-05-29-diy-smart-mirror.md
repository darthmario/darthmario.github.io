I've been looking to build one of these as a project. I love the idea of it... there's a ton of potential in the concept for an awesome product.

> Smart mirrors have been around awhile, and the most prominent version comes from [Michael Teeuw](https://michaelteeuw.nl/). The idea is pretty simple; you’ll build a frame and box. Inside the box, you’ll place one-way glass (often seen on TV in police dramas), a monitor, a Raspberry Pi, and the cables necessary to power your setup. Michael and other contributors have created an open-source [Magic Mirror](https://magicmirror.builders/) platform you can install. Once installed, you can customize it to show your calendar, weather, news, and more. Installing the software is easy—it requires just one line of code.
