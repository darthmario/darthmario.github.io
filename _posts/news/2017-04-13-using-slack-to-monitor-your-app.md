We've been using slack integrations with our git repos, Jenkins, Jira and are looking at integrations with AppDynamics and some extreme feedback items.  We found it incredibly helpful for our team members on support to create some custom [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) scripts.  These tell support things like what time it is on the ship, what version of the application is deployed, how much memory and how many processes things like apache, mysql, and nodejs have.

>As my curiosity grew with each ding, I began to wonder things like, What if there was a failure to create a new user? What if a user registered, logged in but didnâ€™t complete the onboarding process? What is the result of our scheduled tasks? Now that the groundwork was in place, answering these questions was a piece of cake.
