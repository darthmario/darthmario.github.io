This was the specific reason we went to a web app rather than a native app, speed to market. e can update and deploy

>One of the few lines to make its app available fleetwide is Princess Cruises, in part because Princess@Sea is a website accessible through a browser rather than a downloadable program. That approach made it easier to implement, and it is accessible on laptops, at terminals in the ship's Internet cafe and for devices other than mobile phones and tablets.

There are other considerations when working with an environment like a cruise ship as well, particularly that we can deploy to the ships multiple times per week to add features and fix bugs.  On a ship with limited internet bandwidth, we just couldn't ask our passengers to download a new app every time we wanted to add something or fix something.
