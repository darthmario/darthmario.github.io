As someone who battles "procrastination" I can get behind this. There can be a lot of moral judgement from others around proctrastination.  Most offered solutions seem to be about willpower, time management or task management. Most of these solutions aren't solutions at all, particularly when others see you as someone who gets things a lot of stuff done, but deep down you really know about all the stuff you're putting off.

> One [small pilot study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310742411_Meditation_and_Procrastination?utm_campaign=zapier&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=zapier.com) found very low procrastination scores among experienced meditators, suggesting that doing absolutely nothing might be the best way to get everything done.
