Stumbled across this one as I was looking at some old speech synthesis stuff.  Might come in very handy as I work my way through a pile of semi working commodore 64s.

>How do you make sure the SIDs that are in the old C64 in your dad's basement works before attempting a [MIDIBox SID](http://www.ucapps.de/midibox_sid.html), [sammichSID](http://www.midibox.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=sammichsid) or other similar project? (Or midway through the project your dodgy soldering skills makes you wonder if you just blew out your 50$ SID?)
