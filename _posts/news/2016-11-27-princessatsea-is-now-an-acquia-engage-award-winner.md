Very proud of what my team has been able to accomplish with the platform that we rolled out across the princess fleet over the past couple years.  More great things to come!

>After first demoing the app and speaking directly with Nate Craddock, project lead for guest experience applications, it’s a treat to see that Princess Cruises’ ace Princess@Sea mobile app has recently won a well deserved 2016 Acquia Engage Award.

Also liked this bit quite a bit as it is exactly what we have been working toward.

>From my own personal experience using the app, I can attest that it is indeed user-friendly and marks one of the best cruise line endeavors for digitizing and bettering the guest experience, one that is a model that more should mimic.
