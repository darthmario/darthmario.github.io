Fun discussion about Content Management, what we're doing at Princess with Drupal and so on.  I also do sing karaoke...

>Nate Craddock (nate_craddock) Subbu Hariharan (subru77), and Hillary Neaf (nektir) from Princess Cruises join Ted Bowman and Mike Anello to talk about Princess Cruisesâ€™ use of Drupal both on and off-shore. We also cover five stories, five picks of the week, and five questions!
