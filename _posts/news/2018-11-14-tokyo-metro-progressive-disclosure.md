I always find it fascinating how great UX is an interplay of layers from the seemingly obvious to the subtle. All of this takes it’s shape by taking the user centric view and understanding what that users will need from moment to moment and context to context.

>This is exactly what I experienced in Tokyo, by receiving each information at the right moment, I managed to reach my final destination without any worries. Everything went smoothly without even noticing how much I was guided.
