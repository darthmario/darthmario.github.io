Some notes from a talk I gave recently at [Acquia Engage 2015](https://engage2015.acquia.com/speakers/nate-craddock). Short talk, but a great group.

>The Princess@Sea app first launched on one ship in 2013, the Royal Princess, and will be available on all 17 ships in the Princess fleet by the end of the year, said Nate Craddock, project lead and architect for Princess@Sea product team, speaking at Acquia Engage in Boston last week.
