This was a design for an application I intended to build for WebOS to support the [Teambox](https://github.com/redbooth/teambox) application on WebOS mobile phones and Tablets.  This design attempted to expose as much of the Teambox functionality as possible on a tablet screen with mimal need to hop back and forth between pages.  One element of WebOS it definitely was leverating was the collapsable panels so that when in a task view much of the screen could be utilized.

One of the cool things about the [Enyo Framework](http://enyojs.com/) at the time was it was built to support both tablet and mobile layouts of html based applications on WebOS.  Unfortunately HP pulled the plug on WebOS devices before any phone that supported that version of WebOS could be deployed. Enyo lives on on LG TVs and still supports other form factors beyond TVs.
