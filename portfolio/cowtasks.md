Cowtasks was a redesign and rewrite of an existing and open sourced version of [CowTasks](https://launchpad.net/cowtasks) for WebOs. CowTasks was a app interface for WebOS to the web site ["Remember the Milk"](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/)

This was an early project to cut my teeth in mobile design and constraints around a smaller sized screen. These designs were done using the built in WebOS UI framework and layed out in GIMP.  Development only proceeded so far before WebOS was abandoned by HP.

WebOS, while still around on LG TVs, is still missed.  A bit too early on the HTML apps as apps band wagon with hardware that never let it shine, however in the right hands it could be made to do some awesome things.
